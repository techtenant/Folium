## Plotting Markers on the Map
Markers are the items used for marking a location on a map. For example, when you use Google Maps for navigation, your location is marked by a marker and your destination is marked by another marker. Markers are among the most important and helpful things on a map.

Folium gives a folium.Marker() class for plotting markers on a map. Just pass the latitude and longitude of the location, mention the popup and tooltip and add it to the map.
